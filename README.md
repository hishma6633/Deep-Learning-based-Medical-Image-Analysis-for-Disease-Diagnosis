# Deep-Learning-based-Medical-Image-Analysis-for-Disease-Diagnosis
Medical image analysis is essential for
disease diagnosis, and deep learning-based
approaches have shown great potential in this
field. This paper presents a comparative study of
three CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3) for analysing chest X-ray images
and predicting pneumonia outcomes. The study
involves pre-processing, training, and testing the
CNNs on a publicly available dataset of chest Xray images. The performance of each model is
evaluated using various metrics, such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The
study provides insights into the selection of CNN
architectures for disease diagnosis and highlights
the potential of deep learning-based approaches
in medical image analysis.
